# Data Driven Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model for Solving Fokker-Planck Equation

The data of the article shows the one-dimensional system as a case.

A machine learning method based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture model (AGMM) are proposed to deal with the general FP
equations. Compare to the previous numerical discretization method, the proposed method integrates seamlessly data and mathematical models. 
Prior knowledge stemming from assumed mathematical models can improve the performance of a learning algorithm. Also, It yields more interpretable for machine
learning method. Numerical examples for one-dimensional and two-dimensional SDE with one and two noise.
